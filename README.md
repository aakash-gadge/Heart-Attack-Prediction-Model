# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Model
Build a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart attack in patient based on historical data made available on Kaggle.

We will try to build a logistic regression model using sklearn and further improve the model's performance by fine-tuning its parameters to obtain a better precision and recall score.

You can also refer to my article on Medium where I go through the entire process of EDA and model building and try to explain the steps taken.
